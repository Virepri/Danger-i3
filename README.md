# Danger-i3

My current i3wm ricing, based off of the "Danger" theme from Hacknet: Labyrinths

Uses most of the same stuff as Mountains-i3. It's essentially a recoloring of Mountains-i3 with changes to gaps, transparency, etc.

I don't actually have a good GTK theme to use with this, so I use the closest I can get [from gnome-look.](https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1013455/)

If someone wanted to modify arc-dark or make their own theme I'd be incredibly grateful.

Required:

- `i3-gaps`
- `rofi`
- `compton`
- `i3blocks`
- `xfce4-terminal`
- `checkupdates-aur`
- `imgur-screenshot`
- `feh`
- `pactl`
